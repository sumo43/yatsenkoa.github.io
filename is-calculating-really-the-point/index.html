<p>After taking a physics and math class concurrently this semester, I noticed a contrast whenever I was doing homework for each class: The math required for physics was way simpler than anything I was doing in math class, but the problems seemed much more difficult.</p>
<p>When I compared how I was doing the problems for each class, I found that there was a particular step that I was skipping for my math problems, but not for physics: Converting the problem from its description to a series of smaller math problems, which I could then solve for the value I was looking for.</p>
<p>Thinking back to the math classes I took in high school (And the calculus classes I am taking now), the majority of the problems were already &ldquo;framed&rdquo; for me to solve: I knew exactly what function I would use. Whenever I was given one of these problems, I wasn&rsquo;t required to know the exact reason why I was doing what I was doing, or what sort of problem this accomplished outside of the narrow descriptions given by word problems - I just had to compute.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not saying that Math problems are simple, but they boil down to a set of algorithms that you can use to solve a given problem. When doing calculus problems, there are usually a few well-known methods that you are taught, which you are usually expected to memorize before an exam. In short, if you memorize and practice the right things, you can get pretty far in undergraduate math.</p>
<p>Compare this with an average problem from my introductory Physics class: I am given a set of formulas that decribe physical laws, but I&rsquo;m not told how to solve the problem: In fact, for most Physics problems, there are several ways to arrive at the right answer.</p>
<p>Before one of out midterms, we were explicitly told not to &ldquo;study&rdquo; (like you would normally study) for the exam: The point was not to memorize a certain way to solve a problem, but to learn general problem solving.</p>
<p>This difference also makes itself known in programming: You can solve competitive programming problems, which can be challenging to figure out at first, but are a more narrow problem solving domain, or you can code your own app: A Much broader domain, and difficult for <a href="https://blog.tjcx.me/p/consume-less-create-more?s=r">different reasons</a>.</p>
<p>Even though I believe that both ways of thinking are important, There&rsquo;s no point in doing the math if you can&rsquo;t frame the problem right.</p>
